Building a blog page is not very complicated development process but finding things to write can be very hard. After pushing your last commit your webpage finally becomes ready for creating and publishing content. Everything seems OK but wait? What should i post?

I've quickly solved this little crysis by deciding to post about building and having a blog page. If I have a blog, I should have things to talk about blogging, right?

## "Yeeeyy! I have a webpage!"

The biggest motivation to build a web page is having a web page. I find this very cool. Imagine you are in a crowded street and walking by watching the shop windows.
You may be the only person on the street who has a web page. Think about it, you may be the one!
