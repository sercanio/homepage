## What happened?

At 04:17 in the morning on February 6, 2023, a massive earthquake struck in the provinces of Kahramanmaraş and Gaziantep in Türkiye.

On the night of the earthquake, I was asleep in my house in Hatay, the southernmost province of Türkiye, despite the sounds of heavy rain and thunder outside. I was first awakened by a steady but slow shaking. Since the electricity was cut off due to the heavy rain, the house was illuminated only by the lightning outside.

First, I lay down on the side of my bed and pulled my head between my hands and my knees to my stomach. When the shaking lasted for a long time, I felt that I had to get out and stood up. While I was standing, the shaking stopped for a moment and then the ground began to shake with much greater displacement.

It was too late to get out. Lying on the ground again and returning to the previous position, I waited for those moments, which lasted for what seemed like an eternity, to pass as I listened to the things in the house fall to the ground, the thunder and the screams of the neighbors in the apartment building.

When the tremor was over, fortunately the building did not collapse. I quickly found my glasses, coat and phone among the dust and small pieces of rubble scattered on my bed and in my room and left my room. I reached the door by lifting the overturned furniture and threw myself out of the door that I barely opened.

10 minutes later, while I was waiting outside in shock, under heavy rain, a second earthquake struck and the wall of a building in front of me collapsed. When daylight came, it was like the apocalypse.

## So what am i doing right know?

I now live in another city because our house has become uninhabitable, with deep sorrow for the thousands of people who lost their lives. Recently i noticed that my biggest power is **hope**. I never let myself down. I am really proud of myself because i always find a crack to breathe through.

Despite all this, the year 2023 is not completely year of destruction. It is also a year of meaningful and healthy social connections and a satisfying relationship. And with **AWS re/Start** program, 3 months long bootcamp program that i attended, my horizons in IT technologies have doubled.

So now, after a mandatory break, i am continue to enrich my knowledge.
